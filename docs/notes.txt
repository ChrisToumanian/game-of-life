John Conway's Game of Life

An infinite two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which has two possible states, alive or dead.

Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors every generation (step in time).

1) Any cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.

2) Any cell with two or three live neighbors lives to the next generation.

3) Any cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overcrowding.

4) Any cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
